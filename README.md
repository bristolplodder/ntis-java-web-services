NTIS Subscriber Service - README
========================================
	
This is an example implementation of an NTIS Subscriber Service that uses the Spring web-services framework. 
You can import the project into Eclipse and tailor it to suit your needs.
	
Build Requirements	
------------------
To build and deploy the application, Gradle 1.x and JDK 1.6.x needs to be installed and added to your path
	
	e.g. PATH=%PATH%;c:\gradle\bin;c:\jdk1.6.0_26\bin

Setting the Eclipse classpath
-----------------------------
Execute the following command
	
	gradle eclipseClasspath  

Building a WAR from source
------------------------------
From the project root directory simply run

	gradle -i build

and the script will build the SubscriberService.war file under build/libs.

Deploying to Jetty (using Gradle)
------------------------------------
To deploy the application war file on jetty server with gradle, simply run
	
	gradle -i jettyRunWar

It will build and deploy the SubscriberService.war on jetty and the wsdl could be accessed from 
http://localhost:8880/SubscriberService/services/subscriber.wsdl 

Deploying to Tomcat (using Gradle)
-------------------------------------
Ensure CATALINA_HOME points to a valid Tomcat 6.x installation. 

From the project root directory simply run
	
	gradle -i deployTomcat

and the script will build and deploy the SubscriberService.war file on Tomcat and the wsdl could be accessed from 
http://localhost:8880/SubscriberService/services/subscriber.wsdl 

Deploying to Tomcat (manually)
------------------------------
Simply copy the SubscriberService.war file from build/libs folder to %CATALINA_HOME%/webapps folder. 
Once deployed you could invoke the WSDL from http://localhost:8880/SubscriberService/services/subscriber.wsdl
